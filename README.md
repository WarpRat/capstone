# Seattle Central College Project 2019
The intention of this project is to allow a user to set up a fully functional gitlab instance on a new GKE cluster from Google Cloud Shell with only minimal interaction. This is intended to be run from the cloud shell while in a fresh GCP project. This will likely work inside an existing project but it's not garaunteed.

## Instructions
Start the process from the home directory of your Cloud Shell by copy and pasting the following command. Everything else should take care of itself:

`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WarpRat/capstone/master/bootstrap.sh | bash -`
